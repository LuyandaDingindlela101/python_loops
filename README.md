#   TASK 1
Write a program that generates a random number (0-10) and ask you to guess it. You have three asserts.
• Define a random number between 0 - 10.
• Initialize guesses_left to 3.
• Use a while loop to let the user keep guessing so long as guesses_left is greater than zero
• Use an else: case after your while loop to print: You lose.

#   Task 2

#   Exercise 1
• Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
• For each number, if it is divisible by 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number.
• If it’s divisible by 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number.
• For numbers which are divisible by both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.
